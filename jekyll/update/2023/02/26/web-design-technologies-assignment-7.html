<meta name="description" content="Introduction In modules #6 and #7 we covered the basics of PHP, including what it is, how functions work, and how strings work in PHP. Functions in PHP are blocks of code that perform specific tasks and can be called multiple times throughout a program, they can accept parameters as input, and may return a value as output. Strings are sequences of characters which can be manipulated, and String functions are built-in functions that can manipulate strings in various ways. Such as finding the length of a string, searching for a specific character or substring, replacing characters, and converting the case of characters. PHP Basics PHP is an interpreted language executed on the server-side, where scripts are parsed at runtime rather than compiled beforehand. The source code is not visible to the client, and various built-in functions allow for fast development. PHP is compatible with many popular databases and is structurally similar to C/C++. PHP supports both procedural and object-oriented paradigms, and all PHP statements end with a semi-colon. All PHP scripts are enclosed in the reserved &lt;?php tag. PHP variables must begin with a “$” sign and are case-sensitive, with certain variable names reserved by PHP, including form variables ($_POST, $_GET), server variables ($_SERVER), etc. The echo command echo is a PHP command used to output the parameters passed to it to the client’s web-browser. Arithemtic Operations Arithmetic operations are possible with PHP variables, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Concatenation You can concatenate multiple strings using a period to join them into one. For example: $example = &quot;Hello&quot; . &quot; &quot; . &quot;World&quot;; String escapes To display double quotation marks within a string, use the \ [backslash] before the quotation marks to ignore and display them. Control Structures Control structures within PHP include conditional (branching) structures (e.g. if/else) and repetition structures (e.g. while loops). Functions Functions are defined as groups of statements that can be executed as a single unit. The syntax for defining a function is: function name_of_function(parameters) { statements; } Functions must be defined before they can be called, and function headers are of a specific format that does not include a return type. Function names are not case-sensitive, and the function statements must be contained within the function braces String Functions In PHP, string functions are used to manipulate strings, which are sequences of characters. There are various string functions available in PHP that can be used to manipulate strings. Some of the commonly used string functions include strlen(), which is used to find the length of a string; substr(), which is used to extract a portion of a string; str_replace(), which is used to replace a string with another string; and strtolower() and strtoupper(), which are used to convert a string to lowercase and uppercase, respectively. For example, strlen() can be used to find the length of a string as shown below: $string = &quot;Hello, World!&quot;; $length = strlen($string); echo &quot;The length of the string is $length.&quot;; // Output: The length of the string is 13. Assignment For this assignment I created a web form that lets you input a string and click a submit button. The application then uses the strlen() string function to calculate the string’s length and return it back to the user. Here’s the code I used to accomplish this: &lt;?php function getStringLength($string) { return strlen($string); } $string = isset($_GET[&#39;string&#39;]) ? $_GET[&#39;string&#39;] : &#39;&#39;; // Defaults to an empty string if &#39;string&#39; is not defined ?&gt; And getStringLength() is called referenced in the body: &lt;body&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Your String: &lt;?php echo $string; ?&gt;&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Length of the string: &lt;?php echo getStringLength($string); ?&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;form action=&quot;&quot; method=&quot;get&quot;&gt; &lt;label&gt;New String:&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;string&quot; value=&quot;&lt;?php echo $string; ?&gt;&quot;&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Submit&quot;&gt; &lt;/form&gt; &lt;/body&gt;" />

  <h1>Web Design Technologies - Module #7 Blog</h1>

  <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>In modules #6 and #7 we covered the basics of PHP, including what it is, how functions work, and how strings work in PHP.</p>

<p><em>Functions</em> in PHP are blocks of code that perform specific tasks and can be called multiple times throughout a program, they can accept parameters as input, and may return a value as output.</p>

<p><em>Strings</em> are sequences of characters which can be manipulated, and <em>String functions</em> are built-in functions that can manipulate strings in various ways. Such as finding the length of a string, searching for a specific character or substring, replacing characters, and converting the case of characters.</p>

<h3 id="php-basics">PHP Basics</h3>
<p>PHP is an interpreted language executed on the server-side, where scripts are parsed at runtime rather than compiled beforehand. The source code is not visible to the client, and various built-in functions allow for fast development. PHP is compatible with many popular databases and is structurally similar to C/C++.</p>

<p>PHP supports both procedural and object-oriented paradigms, and all PHP statements end with a semi-colon. All PHP scripts are enclosed in the reserved <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;?php</code> tag. PHP variables must begin with a “$” sign and are case-sensitive, with certain variable names reserved by PHP, including form variables ($_POST, $_GET), server variables ($_SERVER), etc.</p>

<h4 id="the-echo-command">The echo command</h4>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">echo</code> is a PHP command used to output the parameters passed to it to the client’s web-browser.</p>

<h4 id="arithemtic-operations">Arithemtic Operations</h4>
<p>Arithmetic operations are possible with PHP variables, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.</p>

<h4 id="concatenation">Concatenation</h4>
<p>You can concatenate multiple strings using a period to join them into one. For example:</p>

<div class="language-php highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$example</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"Hello"</span> <span class="mf">.</span> <span class="s2">" "</span> <span class="mf">.</span> <span class="s2">"World"</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="string-escapes">String escapes</h4>
<p>To display double quotation marks within a string, use the \ [backslash] before the quotation marks to ignore and display them.</p>

<h4 id="control-structures">Control Structures</h4>
<p>Control structures within PHP include conditional (branching) structures (e.g. if/else) and repetition structures (e.g. while loops).</p>

<h4 id="functions">Functions</h4>
<p>Functions are defined as groups of statements that can be executed as a single unit. The syntax for defining a function is:</p>
<div class="language-php highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">function</span> <span class="n">name_of_function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">parameters</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">statements</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Functions must be defined before they can be called, and function headers are of a specific format that does not include a return type. Function names are not case-sensitive, and the function statements must be contained within the function braces</p>

<h3 id="string-functions">String Functions</h3>
<p>In PHP, string functions are used to manipulate strings, which are sequences of characters. There are various string functions available in PHP that can be used to manipulate strings. Some of the commonly used string functions include strlen(), which is used to find the length of a string; substr(), which is used to extract a portion of a string; str_replace(), which is used to replace a string with another string; and strtolower() and strtoupper(), which are used to convert a string to lowercase and uppercase, respectively.</p>

<p>For example, strlen() can be used to find the length of a string as shown below:</p>

<div class="language-php highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$string</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"Hello, World!"</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="nv">$length</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">strlen</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$string</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="k">echo</span> <span class="s2">"The length of the string is </span><span class="nv">$length</span><span class="s2">."</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// Output: The length of the string is 13.</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="assignment">Assignment</h3>
<p>For this assignment I created a web form that lets you input a string and click a submit button. The application then uses the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">strlen()</code> string function to calculate the string’s length and return it back to the user. Here’s the code I used to accomplish this:</p>

<div class="language-php highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>

<span class="k">function</span> <span class="n">getStringLength</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$string</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nb">strlen</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$string</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nv">$string</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">isset</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$_GET</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">'string'</span><span class="p">])</span> <span class="o">?</span> <span class="nv">$_GET</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">'string'</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="s1">''</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// Defaults to an empty string if 'string' is not defined</span>

<span class="cp">?&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>And <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getStringLength()</code> is called referenced in the body:</p>
<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;body&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;h1&gt;</span>Your String: <span class="cp">&lt;?php echo $string; ?&gt;</span><span class="nt">&lt;/h1&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;h2&gt;</span>Length of the string: <span class="cp">&lt;?php echo getStringLength($string); ?&gt;</span><span class="nt">&lt;/h2&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;form</span> <span class="na">action=</span><span class="s">""</span> <span class="na">method=</span><span class="s">"get"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
      <span class="nt">&lt;label&gt;</span>New String:<span class="nt">&lt;/label&gt;</span>
      <span class="nt">&lt;input</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">"text"</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">"string"</span> <span class="na">value=</span><span class="s">"&lt;?php echo $string; ?&gt;"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
      <span class="nt">&lt;input</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">"submit"</span> <span class="na">value=</span><span class="s">"Submit"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;/form&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;/body&gt;</span>
